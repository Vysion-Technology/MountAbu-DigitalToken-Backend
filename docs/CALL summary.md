# Abu Project Discussion Summary: Nikhil Vyas & Team

## 1. Project Overview & Request Types

The system allows citizens (users) to submit two types of requests:

* **New Construction**
* **Renovation/Restoration**

## 2. Request Workflow: New Construction

* **Initial Review**: Requests are first sent to the **SDM (Sub-Divisional Magistrate)**.
* **SDM Actions**: The SDM can approve, reject, or add comments.
* **Rejection Protocol**: If rejected, the user must create a completely new request rather than modifying the existing one.
* **Technical Assignment**: Upon SDM approval, the request is forwarded to the **Token J.E. (Junior Engineer)**.

## 3. The Role of the Junior Engineer (J.E.)

* **Field Inspection**: The J.E. visits the site to take photographs.
* **Material Estimation**: The J.E. determines the phases of construction and the quantity of materials required for each phase.
* **Authority**: The J.E.’s estimates are final and supersede any estimates previously provided by the user.
* **System Input**: The J.E. uploads site photos and material requirements into the system.

## 4. Token Generation System

* **SDM Control**: While the J.E. inputs the data, the SDM holds the authority to generate the material tokens.
* **Trigger**: Once the J.E. submits their report, a "Generate Token" button is activated on the SDM’s dashboard.
* **User Notification**: When the SDM clicks the button, tokens are generated, and the user receives an SMS with the approved material details.
* **Phased Release**: Tokens are released phase-by-phase. The user must complete one phase before they can request tokens for the next.
* **Phase Limits**: A project typically has three phases, with a maximum limit of five.

## 5. Renovation Workflow vs. New Construction

* **Complexity**: Renovation requests follow a more extensive approval path because they start "from scratch" in the system, whereas new construction projects often have pre-existing permissions.
* **Approval Chain**: Renovation requests require approval from:
* Commissioner
* J.E. (Field inspection and layout approval)
* ATP (Assistant Town Planner)
* Legal Department
* Land Department


* **Final Step**: Once these departments report back, the file returns to the Commissioner for final approval before moving to the SDM for token management.

## 6. Complaints Module

* **Categories**: Complaints are organized into 3-4 specific categories.
* **Assignment**: Each category is assigned to a specific J.E.
* **Resolution**: The J.E. is responsible for resolving the issue and must upload a "resolution photo" and comments to close the complaint.

## 7. Outstanding Questions/Action Items

The team identified several points requiring further clarification from the client:

* **User Penalties**: Should any action be taken against users whose requests are repeatedly rejected?
* **Phase Adjustments**: Can the J.E. change material quantities after a phase has been approved?
* **Inspection Frequency**: Are periodic inspections required after tokens are generated?
* **Platform Integration**: Why are initial permissions for New Construction handled on a different platform?
